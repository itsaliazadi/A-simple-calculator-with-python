# A-simple-calculator-with-python
Making a calculator in my opinion is a great way to get your hands dirty with the programming language.
So I decided to have this calculator in python as my first project published on github.
# Requirements
-You first have to have python installed on your computer.\
-You also have to install tkinter.(It allows you to create a gui for your program.)\
 Install it using 'pip3 install tkinter'.
# Running the code
1-Clone down this repository.\
2-type 'python3 main.py' in your terminal.
